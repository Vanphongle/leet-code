1. Start by understanding the problem statement. We are given a string containing only the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'. We need to determine if the string is valid, which means that all open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets in the correct order, and every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

2. One approach to solve this problem is to use a stack. We can traverse the string and for each character, we can check if it is an open bracket or a close bracket. If it is an open bracket, we can push it onto the stack. If it is a close bracket, we can check if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not correspond to the current close bracket. If either of these conditions is true, we can return False. If the traversal completes and the stack is not empty, we can return False. Otherwise, we can return True.
