- The problem statement asks us to find the only integer that appears once in a sorted array where every other integer appears twice.
- Since the array is sorted and the only integer that appears once does not have a duplicate, it means that all the integers before it have a duplicate at the previous index, and all the integers after it have a duplicate at the next index.
- One approach to solve this problem is to iterate through the array and compare each pair of adjacent elements. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n).
- Since the array is sorted, we can take advantage of binary search to find the only integer that appears once in O(log n) time complexity.
- In the given code, we use binary search to find the index of the only integer that appears once in the array.
- We start by setting the left and right boundaries of the search space to the first and last indices of the array, respectively.
- We then compute the middle index of the search space and check if the element at the middle index is equal to the element at the next index (i.e., mid ^ 1) in the array.
- If the middle element is equal to the next element, it means that the single element is not in the left half of the search space. Therefore, we update the left boundary to mid + 1 to search in the right half of the search space.
- If the middle element is not equal to the next element, it means that the single element is either at the middle index or to the left of it. Therefore, we update the right boundary to mid to search in the left half of the search space.
- We repeat these steps until we find the index of the single element in the array.
- Finally, we return the single element at the index we found.
