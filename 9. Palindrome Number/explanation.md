We first check if the input number x is negative. If it is negative, it cannot be a palindrome because the negative sign would be in a different position when the digits are reversed. We return False in this case.
If the input number is non-negative, we convert it to a string using the str function and store the result in a variable s.
We then calculate the length of the string using the len function and store the result in a variable n.
We iterate over the first n/2 digits of the string using a for loop and compare each digit to its counterpart at the end of the string. We use integer division (//) to ensure that the loop iterates only over the first half of the string, rounded down if the string length is odd.
If any two digits are not equal, we know that the input number is not a palindrome and we return False.
If we reach the middle of the string and all digits match their counterparts, we know that the input number is a palindrome and we return True.
